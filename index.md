1. Call things by their name — easy, short and readable variable and function names
2. Avoid globals: if you have global variables or functions in your code, scripts included after yours that contain the same variable and function names will overwrite your variables/functions.
3. Stick to a strict coding style. Clean and valid code means less confusing bugs to fix, easier handover to other developers and better code security. 
4. Comment as much as needed but not more.
5. Avoid mixing with other technologies
6. Use shortcut notation when it makes sense
7. Modularize — one function per task
8. Enhance progressively: In essence what you should do is write code that works regardless of available technology.
9. Allow for configuration and translation. One of the most successful tips to keep your code maintainable and clean is to create a configuration object that contains all the things that are likely to change over time. 
10. Avoid heavy nesting. Nesting code explains its logic and makes it much easier to read, however nesting it too far can also make it hard to follow what you are trying to do.
